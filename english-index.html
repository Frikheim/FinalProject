                            Bullying is a serious psychosocial problem. In addition, technology unfortunately allows for additional opportunities. <a href = "http://barneombudet.no/dine-rettigheter/mobbing/hva-er-mobbing/" target= "_blank">Barneombudet</a> defines bullying as somebody who experiences unwanted attention from someone else. Examples may be: talking about you behind your back, exclusion, violence, threats, and uploading photos or videos of you without your consent.<br><br>
 
                            Bullying may be difficult to detect, technology makes this even more challenging. Children often find themselves in the position of having tell adults on their own. Children often find it hard to tell someone about bullying without being discovered by the bullies while doing so, in addition, sometimes when children let adults know about bullying, there is no follow up.
